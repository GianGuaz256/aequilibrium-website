## 🧭 About 0var

**0var** is a technology company focused on building quantitative and infrastructural solutions for the emerging field of digital asset management and on-chain finance.

We operate at the intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized systems (DeFi), developing tools that enhance transparency, efficiency, and verifiability across the lifecycle of digital yield instruments.

- Our mission is to create a data-driven framework to measure, structure, and eventually integrate the yield generated by low-risk digital assets—such as tokenized T-Bills, stablecoins, and funding rate markets—into the regulated financial ecosystem.

## ⚙️ What We Do

**0var's activities are organized around four complementary pillars:**

### 1. Research & Development

We conduct applied research in Decentralized Finance, with a specific focus on yield-bearing mechanisms, stable asset structures, and tokenized fixed-income products.

Our research explores the fundamental drivers of on-chain yield, analyzing how interest rate dynamics, funding markets, and liquidity cycles interact across decentralized protocols and tokenized real-world assets.

### 2. Quantitative Models & Analytics

We design proprietary models and quantitative metrics to evaluate digital yield sources, assess risk premia, and benchmark market efficiency.

These include:

- Multi-factor models for yield decomposition (base rate, protocol premium, duration spread)
- On-chain Sharpe / Martin ratios and time-decay metrics
- Composite indices to monitor the evolution of the "on-chain yield curve" across different stablecoin and PT markets

Our analytics are built to be reproducible and auditable, combining on-chain data with quantitative finance methodologies.

### 3. Infrastructure & Automation

We develop on-chain and off-chain automation layers to connect digital yield strategies with regulated financial vehicles and index-based products.

This includes:

- APIs and smart contract integrations for NAV and yield tracking
- Automated data pipelines for reporting and independent audit
- White-label modules to support partners in issuing ETPs, funds, or tokenized portfolios based on our indices

### 4. Institutional Partnerships

We partner with regulated entities (ETP issuers, custodians, and auditors) to ensure the highest standards of governance and compliance.

Every potential financial product based on our models is structured, issued, and listed through authorized partners, under full institutional custody and third-party verification.

## 📊 Our Approach

We believe the future of finance will depend on measurable and transparent yield structures.

**Our methodology combines quantitative rigor with verifiable blockchain data, mapping the key components of the on-chain yield ecosystem:**

#### Core Areas of Focus

- **Yield-bearing stablecoins:** exploring overcollateralized and synthetic models offering risk-adjusted yield in USD terms
- **Tokenized T-Bills & RWA:** bridging sovereign or corporate short-duration assets to on-chain formats
- **Funding rate markets:** studying how perpetual swap rates and carry trades reflect macroeconomic cycles and liquidity conditions

Through these building blocks, we aim to build benchmarks, indices, and models that help professional investors, asset managers, and auditors quantify and contextualize digital yield opportunities.

## 🧩 Why It Matters

The on-chain yield market is rapidly maturing but still lacks standardized frameworks for analysis and reporting.

While traditional finance has yield curves, bond indices, and risk-free benchmarks, the digital ecosystem has no equivalent reference yet.

**0var fills this gap by providing:**

- Transparent metrics derived directly from on-chain data
- Standardized methodologies for yield calculation and normalization
- Interoperable frameworks to integrate DeFi returns into institutional-grade portfolios

This approach enables comparability, auditability, and scalability across DeFi and TradFi environments, bridging two previously disconnected worlds.

## 🤝 Partners & Governance

**We collaborate with:**

- **ETP Issuers and Fund Platforms** – for the compliant structuring and listing of yield-linked products
- **Custodians and Security Infrastructure Providers** – to ensure institutional-grade segregation and safekeeping of assets
- **Independent Auditors and Legal Firms** – for continuous transparency, verification, and regulatory alignment

Our governance framework emphasizes traceability, third-party validation, and open data principles.

> **All models and yield references are built to be independently verifiable on-chain.**

## 🌐 Vision

We envision a financial ecosystem where on-chain yield becomes a recognized, measurable, and investable component of global capital markets.

**In this vision:**

- Digital assets are evaluated through quantitative fundamentals, not speculation.
- Investors access transparent yield benchmarks comparable to traditional instruments.
- Regulated products bridge on-chain efficiency with institutional trust.

**Our long-term objective** is to contribute to the standardization of digital yield analytics, helping financial institutions, regulators, and index providers adopt evidence-based frameworks for the next generation of digital asset management.
